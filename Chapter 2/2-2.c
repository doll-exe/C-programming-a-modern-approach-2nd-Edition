/*2. Write a program that computes the volume of a sphere with a 10-meter radius, using the formula v = 4/3Ï€r^3. 
Write the fraction 4/3 as 4.0f/3.0f (Try writing it as 4/3. What happens?) 
Hint: C doesn't have an exponentiation operator, so you'll need to multiply r by itself twice to compute r^3.*/
