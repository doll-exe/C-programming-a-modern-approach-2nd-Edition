REMARK: when solving these problems, I focus on implementing the logic myself.
If I encounter difficulties with syntax or language-specific details, I use Google or ask AI for clarification.
I only ask AI for guidance on logic when I am completely stuck, and even then I make sure to understand and reconstruct the reasoning on my own.
